# globe texture gen

Use this as an example for how to generate new textures for the globe.

## how to use
Just copy-paste goal06.html into a new html file (also needs a local webserver, e.g., `npx live-server`), load your own data and then right-click on 'save' in Chrome on the canvas to get a texture. Store that texture in the main repository as: /static/assets/textures/goalXX.png
