The chart above illustrates how ODA, once the largest flow to developing countries in the early 1990s, has become one of the smallest in today's global financial landscape. ODA nonetheless remains an important element in strengthening government systems and providing public goods crucial for development. Official aid is often more robust during periods of economic uncertainty, but also fluctuates and can change rapidly, as seen in recent years.",
