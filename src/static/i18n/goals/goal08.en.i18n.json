Research by World Bank economists highlights a few policies that have a proven track record.[reference:  Ferreira, Francisco HG, Emanuela Galasso, and Mario Negre. [link: https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/29861 \"Shared prosperity: concepts, data, and some policy examples.\"] World Bank Policy Research Working Paper 8451 (2018).] One set of policies centers on enhancing the health, education, and early childhood development of individuals ([target: 2.2], [target: 4.1] and [target: 4.2]).  Improvements in these areas tend to increase economic productivity ([target: 8.2]), and translate into higher economic output. Eliminating socio-economic gaps in childhood development can improve the economic prospects  in the bottom 40 percent of the income distribution. COVID-19 has resulted in large disruptions to learning for children, compounding existing inequalities. A joint UNESCO, UNICEF, and World Bank report suggests the damage could lead to losses of about $17 trillion in lifetime earnings for children today.[footnote: The World Bank, UNESCO and UNICEF (2021). The State of the Global Education Crisis: A Path to Recovery. Washington D.C., Paris, New York: The World Bank, UNESCO, and UNICEF.] Safety net policies, like conditional cash transfers, which have shown promise for improving access to education and health services, could be salient in responding to the economic fallout of COVID-19 and other crises.",
