The analysis also reveals that these fleets are increasingly fishing in the national waters of low and lower-middle-income countries.[reference: McCauley, Douglas J., Caroline Jablonicky, Edward H. Allison, Christopher D. Golden, Francis H. Joyce, Juan Mayorga, and David Kroodsma. 2018. [link: https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/sciadv.aau2161 \"Wealthy countries dominate industrial fishing.\"] <i>Science Advances</i> 4 (8): eaau2161.] Less than 3 percent of apparent fishing hours were attributed to fishing vessels from low and lower-middle-income countries.[footnote: Fishing hours are “apparent” because they are an approximation of the actual fishing hours spent by a fishing vessel. Fishing hours are not reported, but estimated by Global Fishing Watch by identifying consecutive AIS positions over a period of time in a given area.]",
